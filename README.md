This repository demonstrates idiomatic crate-level error handling with Rust. The `master` branch
implements the error types manually, and the `error-chain` crate uses 
[`error-chain`](https://crates.io/crates/error-chain/) to generate them. It was created as part of
a [presentation](http://saghm.com/rust_results.pdf) given at the November 2017 New York City Rust
meetup.
